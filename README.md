# PickMeUp: a dynamic carpooling service

Pickmeup is a telegram bot running on GAE. Originally forked from [yukuku's telebot](https://github.com/yukuku/telebot). Take a look at the original Reddit [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/3b1pwl/create_your_own_telegram_bot_stepbystep/).

## Note on the token upload
============
add a new file key.py manually (in gitignore) with containining the bot tokens and the MASTER chat_id as follows:
TOKEN = '1294...'
MASTER_CHAT_ID = 13...
